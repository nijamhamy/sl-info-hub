            <p className="lead">
                <strong>Last Updated: January 2025</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Welcome to <strong>SL Info Hub</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains in clear and simple
                terms how information is collected, used, and protected when you access or interact with
                our website or any related services we provide. By using SL Info Hub, you agree to the
                practices described in this policy. If you do not agree with any part of this Policy, you
                should stop using our website and services.
            </p>

            <p>
                SL Info Hub is designed primarily as an informational platform that provides content such
                as news links, weather updates, currency rates, prayer times, and radio streaming options.
                Our focus is on minimizing the collection of data and respecting your privacy as much as
                possible. We do not build user profiles or create accounts, and we avoid collecting
                personally identifiable information unless you intentionally choose to share it with us.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2 className="mt-5">1. Information We Collect (Non-Personal)</h2>
            <p>
                SL Info Hub is built with privacy in mind. We do <strong>not</strong> collect your name,
                address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information (PII) unless you
                voluntarily provide it to us, for example by sending us an email. In normal use of the
                website, you can browse the content without telling us who you are.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, like most websites, some limited technical information is collected automatically
                to help us operate, secure, and improve the service. This information is generally
                non-personal and does not directly identify you. It is used in aggregated or anonymized
                form for analytics, performance monitoring, and troubleshooting.
            </p>

            <h3>1.1 Automatic Data Collection (Analytics)</h3>
            <p>
                To understand how visitors use SL Info Hub and to keep the website running efficiently,
                we may use analytics tools such as Google Analytics or similar services. These tools can
                automatically collect certain non-personal data when you visit or interact with the site.
            </p>

            <p>
                The types of non-personal information that may be collected include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Device information:</strong> General details about the device you use, such as
                    whether it is a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop, as well as the operating system
                    version. This helps us ensure the site works well across different devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Browser information:</strong> The browser type (for example, Chrome, Edge,
                    Safari), language preference, and similar details that allow us to optimize the layout
                    and content for compatibility and localization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Usage data:</strong> Pages you visit, how long you stay on each page, the path
                    you take through the site, and the date and time of access. This information is used
                    to identify which pages are popular, which features are useful, and where we can make
                    improvements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Anonymized IP address:</strong> Your IP address may be processed in a way that
                    allows us or our providers to determine a rough geographic area (for example, city or
                    country) but not to personally identify you. We only use this for security, analytics,
                    and understanding what regions our visitors come from.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Where possible, we configure analytics tools to respect privacy by using anonymization and
                limiting data retention. This information is not used to identify individual users and is
                viewed in aggregated form for trends and statistics.
            </p>

            <h3>1.2 Third-Party APIs (Weather, Rates, Prayers)</h3>
            <p>
                SL Info Hub integrates with trusted third-party APIs to provide live information such as
                weather updates, currency exchange rates, and prayer times. When you request this type of
                data, your browser may communicate directly or indirectly with these external services.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to deliver the requested information, these services may temporarily process your
                IP address and basic technical details. This is a standard part of how internet requests
                work. We do not use these APIs to collect or store your personal data, and we do not
                create profiles based on your usage of these features.
            </p>

            <p>
                We do not store, log, or share any IP addresses received through API calls beyond what is
                technically necessary to operate the service. Each third-party API provider may have its
                own privacy policy, which governs how they process data on their side. You are encouraged
                to review those policies if you want more detailed information.
            </p>

            <h3>1.3 Radio Streaming Activity</h3>
            <p>
                SL Info Hub offers links or players for radio streaming so you can listen to online radio
                stations. When you select a station or click play, your connection is typically made
                directly between your device and the radio provider’s server.
            </p>

            <p>
                SL Info Hub does not listen to, record, or store any part of the audio stream and does not
                track your individual listening history. Any data associated with the radio stream, such
                as your IP address or technical information, is handled under the radio provider’s own
                privacy policy and terms. You should refer to that provider’s documentation for details on
                how they treat your data.
            </p>

            <h2 className="mt-5">2. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website.
                Cookies help websites remember your preferences, keep sessions stable, and collect
                analytics information. SL Info Hub uses cookies and similar technologies to provide a
                smoother and more personalized experience.
            </p>

            <p>We may use the following categories of cookies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These are necessary for the site to function
                    correctly, such as maintaining basic security, loading pages, or keeping track of
                    simple preferences. Without these cookies, parts of the site may not work properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> These cookies help us understand how visitors
                    interact with the website by collecting anonymous statistics. For example, they may
                    tell us how many visitors viewed a particular page or what type of device is most
                    commonly used.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Advertising cookies:</strong> These are used in connection with services like
                    Google AdSense to display ads that may be more relevant to your interests. They can
                    also limit how often you see the same advertisement and help measure the performance
                    of ad campaigns.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                You always have control over cookies. Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies
                through their settings. Disabling certain cookies may affect some features, but the core
                content of SL Info Hub will remain accessible.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2 className="mt-5">3. Third-Party Advertising (Google AdSense)</h2>
            <p>
                SL Info Hub displays advertisements using third-party partners such as Google AdSense.
                These advertising services use cookies and similar technologies to show ads, including
                personalized ads based on your interests and previous browsing activity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Google may use a cookie known as the DART cookie to serve ads based on your visits to SL
                Info Hub and other websites on the internet. This helps ensure that the ads you see are
                more relevant, and it allows Google and advertisers to understand the performance of their
                campaigns.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ads may appear based on topics, general location, or past interactions with other
                    sites.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can manage or opt out of personalized advertising from Google by visiting{" "}
                    <a

            </ul>

            <p>
                SL Info Hub does not control how third-party advertisers use cookies once they are set.
                We do not have access to the information that advertisers directly collect through their
                cookies. Their use of data is governed by their own privacy policies.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2 className="mt-5">4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>
                Any non-personal information collected through SL Info Hub is used only for legitimate and
                limited purposes related to operating and improving the service. We aim to use the minimum
                amount of data necessary to achieve these goals.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improving site functionality:</strong> Usage patterns and technical data help
                    us optimize page loading times, fix layout issues, and make navigation more intuitive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fixing bugs and technical issues:</strong> When errors occur, diagnostic
                    information can help identify the problem and improve stability for all users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Analyzing trends:</strong> Aggregated analytics data allows us to see which
                    content and features are most useful, so we can focus on enhancing them.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We do not sell, rent, or trade your non-personal data to third parties for monetary gain.
                Any sharing that occurs (for example, with analytics or advertising providers) is limited
                to what is necessary to operate those services and is subject to appropriate safeguards.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2 className="mt-5">5. External Links</h2>
            <p>
                SL Info Hub may contain links to external websites, news sources, streaming platforms, or
                other online services that are not operated by us. These links are provided for your
                convenience and to offer additional information or functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you click an external link, you leave SL Info Hub and are subject to the privacy
                policies and terms of that third-party site. We do not control and are not responsible for
                how those sites collect, use, or protect any information you provide to them. You should
                review the privacy policy of each site you visit.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2 className="mt-5">6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                Protecting the limited data that is processed through SL Info Hub is important. We use
                reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to keep data secure and to
                reduce the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Secure HTTPS/SSL:</strong> Our site uses encrypted connections where
                    supported, which helps protect data in transit between your device and our servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Firewall and server protections:</strong> Industry-standard security
                    configurations are used to limit unauthorized access to our hosting environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No user accounts:</strong> Because SL Info Hub does not require account
                    registration or store passwords, the risk of personal account breaches is minimized.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                While we strive to protect all information handled by the site, no method of transmission
                or storage over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You should always use
                secure networks and updated software when browsing online.
