                (the “Website”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). By accessing, browsing, or using SL Info Hub
                in any way, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound
                by these Terms &amp; Conditions and any additional policies referenced here, such as

                If you do not agree with these terms, you should immediately stop using the Website.

            <h4 className="mt-4">1. Use of Our Service</h4>

            <p>
                SL Info Hub is an informational platform that aggregates and displays links to news,
                radio streams, weather information, currency exchange rates, prayer times, and other
                general information for your convenience. The content provided on or through the
                Website is for <strong>informational purposes only</strong> and should not be considered
                professional advice, financial advice, or any other type of certified guidance.
            </p>

            <p>
                While we aim to keep the information accurate and up to date, we do not guarantee
                that all content will always be complete, current, or error‑free. Information may be
                sourced from third‑party providers and APIs, and may change without notice. You are
                solely responsible for how you choose to use or rely on any information you find
                on SL Info Hub.
            </p>

            <p>
                You agree that your use of the Website is at your own risk. We provide the Website
                on an “as‑is” and “as‑available” basis and reserve the right to modify, suspend, or
                discontinue any part of the service at any time without prior notice.
            </p>

            <h4 className="mt-4">2. External Links and Third‑Party Content</h4>

            <p>
                SL Info Hub includes links to external websites and services, such as news sites,
                radio stations, weather providers, currency rate APIs, and other third‑party
                platforms. These links are provided solely for your convenience and do not imply
                any endorsement, sponsorship, or approval by SL Info Hub of the content, policies,
                or services provided by those external sites.
            </p>

            <p>
                We do not control and are not responsible for:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The accuracy, completeness, or reliability of content on external websites.</li>
                <li>Any changes made to external sites after we link to them.</li>
                <li>The availability, performance, or security of external services.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                When you click on an external link, you leave SL Info Hub and are subject to the
                terms, conditions, and privacy policies of that third‑party website. Visiting and
                interacting with any external site is entirely at your own risk. You should review
                the applicable terms and privacy policies of any third‑party site before using it
                or providing any personal information.
            </p>

            <h4 className="mt-4">3. Radio Streams and Media</h4>

            <p>
                SL Info Hub may display lists of radio stations or provide buttons and links that
                open radio streams. These audio streams are hosted and controlled directly by the
                respective radio station or streaming provider. We do not host or manage the audio
                content and have no control over what is broadcast.
            </p>

            <p>
                By clicking on a radio stream, you may be connecting directly to a third‑party
                server. Any interaction with that stream, including data usage, content heard, or
                any issues arising from the broadcast, is strictly between you and the radio
                provider. We are not responsible for:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The content, language, or topics aired on radio streams.</li>
                <li>Any copyright or licensing issues related to the audio content.</li>
                <li>Any damages or losses resulting from listening to or relying on radio content.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If you have concerns about a particular radio station or its broadcast, you should
                contact the station or provider directly.
            </p>

            <h4 className="mt-4">4. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h4>

            </ul>

            <p>
                We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to restrict or block your access to
                SL Info Hub if we believe you have violated these Terms &amp; Conditions, engaged in
                suspicious activity, or posed a risk to the security or stability of the Website.
